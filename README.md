##Description
In this assignment, we are tasked with creating a web application that visualizes earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The application displays earthquake locations, magnitudes, and depths on an interactive map. Additionally, it provides a legend to help users interpret the depth color coding.

##To Start
To run this project yourself, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

  In terminal-
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/earthquake-data-visualization.git

Open the index.html file in your web browser. (or live server for VS Code)

##To Use
Upon opening the web page, you will see a map with markers representing earthquake locations.
Clicking on a marker will display information about the earthquake, including location, date, magnitude, and depth.
The depth of each earthquake is color-coded in the legend on the bottom right corner of the map.
